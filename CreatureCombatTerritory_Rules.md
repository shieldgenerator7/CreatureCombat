Creature Combat Territory

# Concept

There will be 5 lands cards drawn from a deck of about 50 or so land cards. You place any number of your creature cards face down in front of the land cards. Then when each player is ready, you flip up your creature cards for each land card and tally the total power of the creatures at that land card. If your total power is higher than the opponent’s, you win and claim that land card. Then repeat for the other land cards. Afterwards, regardless if you won or lost, your creatures go to the recharge pile, and another land card is drawn to take its place. When all the land cards have been claimed, the player with the most land cards wins the game.

That’s the basic idea.

# Deck Building

Each player comes to the table with a deck of creatures and a deck of lands. The total cost of your creature deck and the amount of lands in your land deck can vary from the rules below, but the total cost and land amount must be agreed upon by both players ahead of time.

## Creature Deck

Your creature deck can have a total cost of 100 or less. Each creature has a cost ranging from 0 to 100, depending on its stats and abilities. There is no minimum or maximum card count. You could have 10 creatures in your deck that each cost 10, or 100 creatures that each cost 1, or just 1 creature that costs 100. It’s up to you to decide what’s optimal for your deck.

## Land Deck

Your land deck must contain 25 lands. Your lands and the opponent’s lands will be shuffled together into the same deck, so it’s best if you use card sleeves for the lands with backs distinct from your opponent’s.

# Setup

1.  Shuffle your land deck.
2.  Shuffle your opponent’s land deck.
3.  Shuffle your land deck into your opponent's land deck.
4.  Place your creature deck face down on the table. No need to shuffle it.

# Gameplay

There’s 4 phases to each round:

-   Round Begin
-   Deploy
-   Combat
-   Round End

## Round Begin

Deal 5 land cards into the space between players.

## Deploy Creatures

Each player deploys any number of their ready creatures to the 5 lands. You can spread them out however you wish. You can add any number of creatures to each land. You don’t have to deploy all your creatures. You don’t have to deploy creatures to each land.

To deploy a creature, place it face down in front of the land you wish to deploy it to. If you deploy multiple creatures to the same land, place them in the same pile.

## Combat

Do combat for each land separately. For each land:

1.  Reveal your creatures deployed at that land.
2.  Count up your creatures’ total power at that land.
3.  Determine which player has the highest total power.
4.  If you have the highest total power, you claim that land.
    1.  If two or more players are tied for highest total power, the land does not get claimed.
5.  If you claim the land, put it in your land pile.

## Round End

When the round ends, do the following:

1.  If you have Resting piles with Rest counters on them,
    1.  Remove 1 Rest counter from each Resting pile.
    2.  If a Resting pile now has 0 Rest counters, move it into your Ready pile.
2.  Pull back your deployed creatures.
    1.  If a creature has Base Power 0 or less, put 1 additional Rest counter on it.
    2.  If a creature has at least 1 Rest counter on it, place it in a separate Resting pile based on how many Rest counters it has.
    3.  If a creature has no Rest counters on it, then place it in your Ready pile.
3.  If you have lands in your land pile,
    1.  For each land card, you may remove 1 Rest counter from 1 creature.
    2.  Move that creature to the Resting pile that has the same amount of Rest counters.
    3.  If that creature’s last Rest counter is removed, move it to your Ready pile.
    4.  You may remove multiple Rest counters from a single creature.
    5.  You may remove Rest counters from multiple creatures.
4.  Then move onto the next round.

# Win Condition

The game ends when all the lands have been claimed. The player with the most lands wins the game.

Alternatively, if a player obtains 50% of the lands +1 land, then you may agree to end the game early, declaring them the winner.

Any player can forfeit the game, leaving the game. The last player left wins the game. When a player forfeits, the land cards they claimed don’t go back into the land deck.

When a game ends, redistribute the land cards to the player that owns them.

# Cards

There’s two types of cards: Land Cards, and Creature Cards.

## Land Cards

Land cards are the battlegrounds where your creatures fight. Winning in a battleground lets you claim that land for yourself, getting you closer to winning the game.

Land cards each have a biome, and potentially an ability.

Biomes include

-   Forest
-   Mountain
-   Plain
-   Lake
-   Ocean
-   Swamp
-   Desert
-   Tundra
-   Jungle
-   Cloud
-   Volcano

There are no set pre-defined biome it has to be. You can come up with your own biome and make it into a land card.

However, if you do make your own biomes, you’ll have to explain why it’s different from the base biomes. If it’s determined that they’re the same, then your new biome will function as if it were the base biome. For example, Cliff and Mountain could be argued to be the same, so creatures good on Mountains will also be good on Cliffs. Same with Hill and Plain, if it’s all grass, creatures good on either will be good on both.

Each creature has a home biome that it’s good in. Some creatures have more than one home biome, and are varying degrees of good in all of them. Creatures that are good in a biome get power bonuses and abilities in those biomes they are good in.

Land cards can also have passive abilities, such as “Flying creatures get +2 power here.”

Lands can be used to speed up your creature’s recovery. During the Round End phase, you can remove a single Rest counter from a creature for each land you have. Some lands have the ability to remove multiple Rest counters depending on the creature’s home biomes and their type.

## Creature Cards

Creatures are the units that battle on the lands to win them for your team. Creatures don’t die, but they need rest, sometimes more time to rest if they were injured in battle.

Here are the creature stats:

-   Name – The name of this individual creature.
-   Species – The species name of this creature.
-   Type – Any type tags you want to apply to this creature (Flying, Canid, Ungulate, Fire, etc.)
-   Star Count – How powerful this creature is
-   Total Cost – The cost of putting this card in your creature deck.
-   Base Power – The power of this creature, Irregardless of which biome it’s fighting in
-   Biome A Bonus – The power bonus this creature receives when fighting in Biome A. Each creature can have multiple of these
-   Ability – An ability this creature can use, often costing rest time or requiring it to be in a home biome

### Name

Give this creature a name, and write it on the card, with your own handwriting. This gives it a personal touch and makes the creature more personal to you. It’s like naming your Pokemon.

### Species

This is the name of the species of the creature, often printing in ink like the rest of the card.

### Type

What kind of creature is this? Use types like in Magic The Gathering: you can have any amount of types, and in any variety. There’s some that are included in the base game, but you can have your creature be any type you want. There’s no type bonuses in the base mechanics like in Pokemon, so don’t worry about playing your Fire type creature into an opponent’s Water type creature. Types work like in Magic The Gathering, in that abilities of certain creatures and lands reference those types to give tribal bonuses and effects.

### Star Count

A creature’s star count is a way to quickly gauge how powerful it is. A creature’s Star Count is equal to its Final Cost divided by 10, round up.

### Total Cost

The total cost of a creature is determined by its other stats: Base Power, Biome Bonuses, and Abilities.

The base total cost is 0, and then you add to this when you add points to the other stats.

For each point in Base Power, increase Total Cost by 2.

For every 2 points in any Biome Bonus, increase Total Cost by 1. If you have 1 point left over, count it as 2.

Abilities have varying costs depending on what it does and the requirements to play it.

Total Cost = (Base Power \* 2) + RoundUp(Total Biome Bonus / 2) + (Total Ability Cost)

If your creature’s total cost is high enough, it might be eligible for cost discounts. For example, if your creature’s Base Total Cost is 90, it would be eligible for a cost reduction of let’s say 9, making its Final Total Cost equal to 81.

The Final Total Cost is what you use to determine the total cost of your deck. The Final Total Cost has a minimum of 1.

### Base Power

This is the power of the creature no matter in which biome it is fighting.

### Biome Bonus

This is the power bonus the creature receives when it is fighting in the given biome. Each biome bonus declares a biome and a bonus. When the creature fights in that specific biome, they get that bonus to their power.

The biome bonus can be negative. A shark wouldn’t fare too good on a mountain, for example.

Each creature can have multiple biome bonuses. A deer is good in the mountains, in the forest, and in the plains, for example.

If a creature has a positive bonus in a biome, it is said to be a home biome. Some abilities require a creature to be in a home biome to activate.

If the creature is fighting in a biome in which it doesn’t have a biome bonus or detriment for, it just uses its Base Power with no biome bonuses.

### Ability

Each creature can have one or more abilities.

An ability might have a cost associated with it, which must be paid to activate it. For example, it might require that the creature gains 2 Rest counters when it leaves the battlefield. Or an ability might require that the creature is in a home biome in order to activate.

Some abilities are passives which activate when a certain condition is met.

Some abilities are activatable. You can activate these abilities at any time, as long as the creature is deployed to a land. Creatures in your Ready piles and Resting piles cannot use their abilities. You can activate each creature’s ability only once per round. You can activate multiple creatures’ ability per round, even if those creatures are deployed to the same land. If a creature has more than one ability, you may activate more than one in a round.

Some abilities require the creature to not add its power to the total in order to use.

Unless otherwise specified, a creature’s ability effects are limited to the land they are on, unless otherwise specified. For example, “All creatures gain +1 power.” This means all creatures on that land, and not other creatures on other lands.

# Creature Abilities

Each creature can have one or more abilities.

Here’s some examples of abilities creatures can have.

-   Roar – 1 Rest Counter: All other creatures get -1 Base Power.
-   Shield – Support: Enemy effects can’t make ally creatures lose Base Power.

Each ability has the following:

-   Name
-   Cost
-   Requirement
-   Effect

## Name

The name of the ability, for easy reference. Each species might name the ability differently, even if it has the same effect. For example, an octopus might have a grab move called “Tentacle”, while an T-Rex’s grab move would be called “Jaws”.

## Cost

What does it cost to use this ability? Activating the ability requires some kind of change of game state.

Common costs:

-   Rest X – Add X amount of rest counters to the creature when it activates this ability.
-   Support – This creature doesn’t add its power to the Total Power for claiming the land.
-   Exhaust X – This creature loses X amount of Base Power.
-   Sacrifice – This creature is removed from the game when the round ends.
-   Disorient X – This creature loses X amount of Biome Bonus in the relevant biome.

## Requirement

What conditions need to be satisfied in order for this ability to be active / be activated? The game state needs to meet this condition for it to work.

Common requirements:

-   Home – The creature must be in a home biome. If the creature would be in a home biome but its biome bonus has been reduced to 0 or below, then this condition is longer met.
-   Biome A – The creature must in biome A. It doesn’t matter if the creature has a bonus or not in this biome.
-   Type Group – The creature must be fighting with another ally creature that shares a type.
-   Type Group X – The creature must be fighting with at least X other ally creatures that share at least one type with it.
-   Type Group A – The creature must be fighting with another ally creature that shares type A with it.
-   Type Group A X - The creature must be fighting with at least X other ally creatures that share type A with it.
-   Alone – The creature must be fighting alone.

## Effect

The change to the game state this ability makes while active / when activated.

Common effects:

-   Allies get +1 Base Power.
-   Enemies get -1 Base Power.
-   Allies of type A get +1 Base Power.

## Taking Damage

Creatures don’t have hitpoints, per say, but some abilities say “Deal 2 damage” for example. When a creature takes damage, its Base Power is reduced by that amount. A creature’s Base Power cannot be reduced below 0. If a creature’s Base Power is reduced to 0, it gets a number of extra Rest counters equal to its Star Count.

All damage is removed when the creature leaves the battlefield.
