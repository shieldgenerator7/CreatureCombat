-Homebound (can only be played to a Home biome)(total power 0 unless played to a Home biome)
-Social X (can only be played to a Land with X allies that share a type with it)(total power 0 unless it has X allies that share a type with it)
-Afraid (when a creature with higher base power is played, this Creature leaves battle)
-Indigenous (instead of deploying to deploy zone, play faceup directly at Land)
